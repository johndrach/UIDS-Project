                        Currently there is no way to upgrade your license(s) on wrapbootstrap, however you may purchase the Single Application License for an evaluation purpose and later obtain the license you actually need before releasing your end product.

                        I plan to make a SaaS based application where I would sell the users access/time to the end product, which license type do I need?

                        If you modified the template and want to resell the end product, then the platform used for it does not matter that much; in this case SaaS is used to sell the users access/time to the product you created, so in essence you are reselling the product. For this purpose you would need to obtain an extended license.
